This project has taught me a lot. A lot about programming in Android. I faced some fierce bugs. It took me a while to overcome them. My biggest truimph was figuring out I should use a singleton.  I had to keep data, that was always reset due to the Activtied cycling. Finally I found out that the application class doesn't destructs itself and I used it accordingly.
