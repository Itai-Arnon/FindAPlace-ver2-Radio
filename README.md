This project has taught me a lot. A lot about programming in Android. I faced some fierce bugs. It took me a while to overcome them. My biggest truimph was figuring out I should use a singleton.  I had to keep data, that was always reset due to the Activty end cycle. Finally I found out that the application class doesn't destructs itself, that's it's a singleton and I used it accordingly.
